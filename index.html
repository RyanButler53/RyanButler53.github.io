        <p>Welcome to my website! Despite being written in 2024, it looks like it was made in 2004. I am NOT a front end developer. I update it every 6 years and maybe will finish it...</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ryan. I am a back end developer focused on code performance and simulation projects. I am particularly interested in using
            specialized data structures to solve problems. 
            I have worked extensively with computational modeling and designing specific data structures to
            handle the interfaces required for efficiently simulating complex systems. Comfortable using matplotlib to 
            visualize large scale datasets and using SQL databases. I manage my own project roadmaps and development timelines using a Kanban board.
        </p>

        <p>I currently work as a software engineer at Areté Associates where I build cool software. I have worked with Areté since June 2024. </p>
        <p>
        I occasionally have time to work on personal development projects. These projects are generally where I learn new development skills. 
        Right now I am trying to improve at using multithreaded designs and use the NASA api to find aliens.
        </p> 
        <p> 
        When I am not developing software, I am typically either running or writing/performing music. 
        I play string bass for the Pasadena Community Orchestra and write music in my spare time. 
        I  enjoy running through the mountains and my favorite distance is the half marathon (PR 1:30:21). I am also a chef; I am most comfortable 
        with omelettes but have been known to try foods from around the globe. I am very experienced at <a href="https://royaleapi.com/player/2CL8J90GC"> Clash Royale</a>
    </p>
