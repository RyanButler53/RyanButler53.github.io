    <h3>Docker Containier (April 2024)</h3>

    <p>
        About: The Quartet “Docker Container” describes my experiences with working with a Docker Container through a string quartet. Docker is used in software development to run a virtual machine (called a container) and make all external libraries work seamlessly. 
        However, Docker doesn't always work as expected and when it doesn't work it is frustrating and demoralizing. In this piece, the exposition introduces 2 themes. Both of which are happily in A major but the second theme has a hint of B minor to represent the uncertainty of working with Docker. After the repeat, the piece enters a development section. 
        This section represents the struggles of trying to debug a docker container as it has its ups and downs represented by modulations of the theme into different major and minor keys, a relaxed canon and a frantic first violin part over the main theme in a minor key. The “recapitulation” represents the docker container working as expected. 
        This section combines both themes together into a consonant climax of the piece. “Docker Container” was influenced by the first movement of Beethoven's 10th string quartet.
