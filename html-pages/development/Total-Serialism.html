    <h1>Generating Total Serialism Sheet Music</h1>
    
    <h3> Project Date: Thanksgiving Break 2023 </h3>

    <h2> Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This project aims to either take in some structure for a total serialist piece of music or just a random seed and 
        will create a piece of total serialist music. The project essentially implements a compiler for a simple (ish) total serialism "language" 
        or takes a random seed and creates lilypond code. It then runs the lilypond compiler to make a PDF of the sheet music. 

        Future iterations of the project will make the Total serialist Language more fleshed out with more options and include a better front end for random music. 
        I am unable to make midi playback work however I don't particularly want to hear more total serialist music.

        <h2> What is Total Serialism?</h2>
        <p>Total Serialism is a type of music where everything is predetermined before writing
            Total Serialism generalizes on the idea of serialism and uses the rows to apply to rhythms, articulations and dynamics. 
            Serialist style music (or 12-Tone) music uses all 12 tones in an equal temperment system (ie a piano) to make music. 
            It is written by creating a row (denoted as P-0) and using the P-0 row to build a 12 tone matrix out of it. 
            Using this matrix, one can use different transpositions or inversions of the row to make music. The P-0 row is chosen
            before writing the music and which combinations of inverted, transposed or reversed rows are used. 
            In Serialist music the composer gets to choose the octave of the note and the rhythm as well as add their own dynamics or 
            artiulations as they see fit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in Total Serialism, Rhythms, Dynamics and Articulation are also
            predetermined by a row. This lends itself to a very algorithmic approach to music composition. 

            <br>
            Total Serialism style music often is extremely unappealing to listen to and is very difficult to play due to the 
            precision needed. However its algorithmic nature lends itself nicely for a programming project.

        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>This project leverages the <a href="https://lilypond.org">Lilypond</a> compiler to turn a text file into sheet music through a shell script. 
            There are two modes of generation: Randomly generated music or music generated off of the mini total serialist language. 
            When the mode of music generation is random, all rows are randomly generated while when using a text input file they are from the user's input. </p>
        
        <p>
            The program then creates the appropriate 12 tone matrices for each row then generates music from them. 
            Each row is added to a text file in proper lilypond syntax.  
        </p>

        <p>The program is run through a shell script that invokes the lilypond compiler and opens the resulting sheet music.</p>

        <h2>Codebase and Roadmap</h2>
        <p>The code is in <a href="github.com/RyanButler53/total-serialism"></a>
        It is not quite done and there is no front end. Some roadmap items include 
        <ul>
            <li>Add better user input error checking</li>
            <li>Add a proper front end so it is easier to run the code correctly and prevent user errors </li>
            <li>Add support for different time signatures. </li>
        </ul>
