    <h1>Path of Legends Simulation</h1>
    
    <h3> Project Date: March 2023 </h3>

    <h2> Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this project was to create an efficient simulation of Clash Royale's Path of Legends (POL). 
        The project was motivated by the question "How do we make the Path of Legends more enjoyable?" This question 
        began the investigation into the trade offs between making the POL shorter and maintaining 1% of players finishing the path every season. 

        I first built a simulation from scratch in C++ then added in a bunch of different parameters to tweak with Path parameters. 
        Using this simulation, I encoded the current path system rules into my model and used this to figure out how many battles were played in a season. 
        I found this number to be roughly 62 million. After this, I wrote a short experiment script to try out different path of legends configurations. 

        By the end of experimentation, I found two sets of parameters that made the path 
        take less time to complete but kept the end of the path restricted to the top 1% of players.
